Q1
══

  • Total: 9/10
    • bubble.go contains a syntax error: in GoLite, append takes exactly
      two arguments, unlike Go. (-1)
    • atoi is a good program, but it won't type check in GoLite as we
      don't support indexing into strings.

══

    • Interesting details in the report
    • It's fine if you don't support arbitrary-precision numbers in your
      compiler, we don't ask for that in GoLite
    • Please make sure the PDF output is correct; the margin is a bit
      too wide and causes words to be cut in weird places
